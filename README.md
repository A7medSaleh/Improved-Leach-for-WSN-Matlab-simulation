In this code I build and simulate a wireless sensor network (WSN) using improved LEACH protocol in communicating and compare that to the ordinary leach protocol. The parameters of the network is set then it is simulated till all nodes are dead then the analysis of the network behavior is plotted showing its lifetime and the amount of data sent before all nodes get drain their batteries for the two algorithms.

The proposed I-LEACH (Improved LEACH) ensures that the elected cluster-heads will be uniformly distributed over the network. Hence, there is no possibility that all cluster-heads will be concentrated in one part of the network. At the end of simulation the performance of the proposed I-LEACH protocol is evaluated

This software can be used in various fields like research in field of building a wireless sensor network and investigating the use of Leach protocol to save network energy
